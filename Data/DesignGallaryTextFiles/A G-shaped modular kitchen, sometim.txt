A G-shaped modular kitchen, sometimes referred to as a peninsula kitchen, is a kitchen layout that combines the features of an L-shaped kitchen with an additional extension that forms a partial fourth wall, creating a G shape. This design is perfect for those who need extra counter space, storage, and an additional area for seating. Here's how to design and make the most of a G-shaped modular kitchen:

1. Layout: The G-shaped layout features three walls of cabinets and countertops, forming a U shape, with an extension or peninsula that serves as an additional workspace and often a seating area.

2. Cabinets and Storage: Utilize all three walls for cabinets and storage. This layout offers ample storage space. Consider a combination of upper and lower cabinets, and use pull-out or pull-down mechanisms for better access to items in lower cabinets.

3. Countertops: Select a durable countertop material like granite, quartz, or solid surface. Ensure there's plenty of counter space for food preparation and utilize the peninsula as a breakfast bar or for additional workspace.

4. Appliance Placement: Place appliances thoughtfully. One wall can house the cooking range, oven, and microwave, another can accommodate the sink, dishwasher, and food preparation area, and the third wall can be used for the refrigerator and pantry, if available.

5. Sink and Faucet: Choose a functional sink and a good-quality faucet. The sink can be positioned on the wall or the peninsula. Ensure there's enough space around the sink for various kitchen tasks.

6. Lighting: Proper lighting is essential. Install under-cabinet task lighting on the main countertop workspace. Pendant lights above the peninsula can provide task and ambient lighting.

7. Ventilation: Invest in a quality range hood or an over-the-range microwave with a built-in vent to ensure proper ventilation and eliminate cooking odors.

8. Color and Design: Select a color scheme and design that suits your style and complements the overall aesthetics of your home. Lighter colors can make the space feel more open and inviting.

9. Flooring: Choose a flooring material that is easy to clean and durable. Tiles, laminate, or hardwood are popular choices. Ensure that it complements the overall design of the kitchen.

10. Organizational Accessories: Utilize kitchen organizers and accessories like pull-out pantry shelves, utensil dividers, and spice racks to keep your kitchen well-organized.

11. Personalization: Make the kitchen your own with personal touches. Add open shelves for displaying dishes, cookbooks, or decorative items. Decorate with plants, artwork, or your preferred kitchen accessories.

12. Maintenance: Keep in mind that a G-shaped modular kitchen requires regular maintenance. Follow the manufacturer's recommendations for caring for cabinets, countertops, and appliances.

A G-shaped modular kitchen provides additional counter space, storage, and often a seating area, making it a versatile and highly functional design for larger kitchens. It's suitable for those who enjoy cooking and entertaining.
