Vinyl flooring is a versatile and popular flooring option known for its durability, ease of maintenance, and affordability. It's suitable for a wide range of applications, from residential to commercial spaces. Here's an overview of vinyl flooring:

Types of Vinyl Flooring:

1. Sheet Vinyl: Sheet vinyl is sold in large rolls and provides a continuous, seamless look. It's a practical choice for high-traffic areas and spaces where moisture resistance is essential. Installation usually requires professional help to ensure a smooth and wrinkle-free surface.

2. Vinyl Plank Flooring: Vinyl plank flooring mimics the look of hardwood planks. It's available in various wood grain patterns and colors, providing a cost-effective alternative to real wood flooring. Planks are typically installed as a floating floor, making it a DIY-friendly option.

3. Vinyl Tile Flooring: Vinyl tile flooring replicates the look of ceramic or stone tiles. It comes in various sizes and styles, including squares and rectangles, offering versatility in design. Vinyl tiles are often installed with adhesive or as peel-and-stick tiles, depending on the product.

4. Luxury Vinyl Plank (LVP) and Luxury Vinyl Tile (LVT): LVP and LVT are premium vinyl flooring options known for their enhanced quality, realistic wood and stone looks, and thicker wear layers. They provide a high-end appearance and are suitable for both residential and commercial use.

Benefits of Vinyl Flooring:
